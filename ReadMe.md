### About Me

Hi, I'm Caner Duzenli - an entry-level software developer with a background in 
environmental engineering and occupational health science. I specialize in HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript and have experience managing websites, communicating with
stakeholders, and organizing schedules.

Additionally, I am knowledgeable in AutoCAD, recycling materials, project
management, and aircraft systems. I am a problem-solver with excellent
communication skills, and I thrive in team environments.

I'm passionate about constantly learning and incorporating new technologies to
create innovative solutions that positively impact the environment. Check out my
GitHub profile to see examples of my work, including a simple calculator and
temperature converter developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
